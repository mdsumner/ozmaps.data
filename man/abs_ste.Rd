\description{
These data sets are simplifications of the formal statistical areas
and regions published by the ABS in 2016.
}
\details{
Each layer was read from the source file with 'sf' package and attributes were removed, leaving a single 'NAME'
column from the year-specific column names. The geometry has been
simplified using `rmapshaper::ms_simplify` with default arguments (0.05 detail).

Several layers are not included from the total available.

The entire nation layer 'AUST' is not included
as it is the union of the State and Territory layer.

Statistical Areas Level 1 is not included as it is very large (56Mb after simplification).

The mesh blocks are not included.
